# Edutube ðŸŽ“ðŸ“º

**Edutube** is an innovative educational platform designed to make learning more interactive and accessible through YouTube videos. It provides a structured way to learn subjects, topics, and concepts, transforming passive video watching into an engaging, hands-on experience. With Edutube, users can dive deeper into educational content, get critical insights, and interact with concepts in real time.

## Features

### 1. **Structured Learning Path**
   - Start with a **list of subjects** across various disciplines like **Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science**, etc.
   - Drill down by selecting a **topic** within the subject (e.g., selecting *Physics* leads to *Kinematics*).
   
### 2. **Curated Video Content**
   - **Smart Search**: Edutube finds and lists high-quality YouTube videos relevant to the selected topic.
   - **Concept Extraction**: Each video is analyzed to highlight important concepts based on the transcript, providing a quick overview of the main ideas covered in the video.

### 3. **Interactive Learning Experience**
   - **Interactive Playground**: While watching a video, a playground panel to the right displays the **key concepts** and **timestamps** for quick navigation.
   - **Concept Animations and UI**: For each highlighted concept, Edutube generates interactive visualizations and animations that allow users to engage with the material, reinforcing understanding and retention.

## How It Works

1. **Select a Subject**: Start by picking a subject you're interested in, like Physics or Mathematics.
2. **Choose a Topic**: Next, select a topic within the subject, like Kinematics for Physics.
3. **Watch and Learn**: Edutube finds relevant videos and generates a list. Select a video to watch directly on the platform.
4. **Engage with Concepts**: The interactive playground to the right of the video breaks down the video content into important concepts, complete with animations, examples, and interactive exercises.
